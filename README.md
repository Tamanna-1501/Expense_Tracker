## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or cloud)

---

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone & Navigate
```bash
cd Expense-tracker-AI-project
```

### Step 2: Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/expenseDB
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-in-production
PORT=5000
```

**Note:** Make sure MongoDB is running locally or update `MONGO_URI` with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 3: Setup Frontend

```bash
cd ..
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_GROQ_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
```

To get a Groq API key:
1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com)
2. Create an account
3. Generate an API key
4. Add it to your `.env` file

Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

- Check `MONGO_URI` in `.env`
- Verify PORT 5000 is not in use

### Frontend API errors
- Check that backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` in `.env`
- Check browser console for detailed errors

### Groq API errors
- Verify `VITE_GROQ_KEY` is set correctly
- Check Groq API key validity at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
- Ensure you have API credits available

### Database issues
- For MongoDB locally: Install from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- For MongoDB Atlas: Create cluster at [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
